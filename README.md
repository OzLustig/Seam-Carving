## Image Processing and Seam Carving

In this exercise you will implement and explore image resizing using the seam carving
algorithm, along with other basic image processing operations.

To illustrate the different operations you are provided with an example working java
application that illustrates these operations:

- Changing the image's hue – already implemented as an example.
- Conversion into grayscale.
- Calculation of gradient magnitude.
- Resizing an image using three methods:
     Nearest neighbor.
     Bilinear interpolation.
     Seam carving.

You are also provided with partial code, which you will need to complete to achieve an
application that is similar to the given one.


## What you should do

1. Install java (jdk) 9, if you are using macOs this video will guide you how to remove the
    older version of jdk.
2. Run ex1complete.jar, which is a binary similar to what you are going to implement, and
    play around.
    If double click doesn’t work, you can run the next command line:
    java -jar ex1complete.jar
3. Read the partial code given in the src directory for this exercise. Understand what each
    class does and how.
4. You can use any kind of java IDE, but we will check you solution with eclipse, make sure
    it works in eclipse before you submit.
5. Your responsibility is to fill in the missing pieces according to the functionality described
    below. **Implement** all TODO's in the code (search for the string "TODO" and replace it
    with your code). The final result should behave the same as ex1complete.jar.
6. Submit your implementation in a zip file according to the submission guidelines below.
